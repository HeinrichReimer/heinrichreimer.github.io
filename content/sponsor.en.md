## Why?

I focus on bringing _well-documented libraries_ to the open source community.
Most of the time, I write for _Android_, _Kotlin_ or _Java_, but I like to experiment with other frameworks, such as _Flutter_ or _LaTeX_.

Sponsoring helps me find more time for contributions.
Besides, it also helps cover university-related expenses.
