# heinrichreimer.github.io
My personal portfolio

##Update:
Even though I cloned my portfolio and made a jekyll site from it, I won't be able to use it as my main portfolio page unfortunately.
The reason is that GitHub pages currently [don't support HTTPS for custom domains][1] so I can't link it to [http***s***://heinrichreimer.com][2] and I want all my websites to be encrypted.
