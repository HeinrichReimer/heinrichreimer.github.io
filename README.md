# heinrichreimer.github.io
My personal portfolio

## Update:
Even though I cloned my portfolio and made a jekyll site from it, I won't be able to use it as my main portfolio page unfortunately.
The reason is that GitHub pages currently [don't support HTTPS for custom domains][1] so I can't link it to [http***s***://heinrichreimer.com][2] and I want all my websites to be encrypted.

## Update #2
My website [https://heinrichreimer.com][2] is now built by cloning this and then executing Jekyll locally. Not very integrated in GitHub, but whatever... BTW it uses [LetsEncrypt][3] and you should too!
